# Design Implementation: Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard

This file outlines the UI/UX strategy using **Streamlit** to visualize system health. For a founding role, the design must prioritize **Observability**.

## 1. Layout Requirements
- **The "Pulse" Header:** Real-time display of current Ingestion Speed (Sequences/sec) vs. Processing Speed (Groq Analysis/sec).
- **The Helix Feed:** A live-scrolling text area showing the raw DNA sequences being generated by the Rust core.
- **The Mutation Alert Log:** A table that populates whenever Groq identifies a "MUTATION" in a sequence.
- **The Throttle Gauge:** A visual dial showing the "Backpressure Level" (0-100%).

## 2. Implementation Steps
1. **State Initialization:** Use `st.session_state` to store the buffer of analyzed sequences.
2. **The Loop:** Create a `while True` loop that reads from the Antigravity state and updates `st.empty()` containers.
3. **The Control Panel:** Add a "Simulate Data Spike" button to manually flood the system and watch the Antigravity throttle kick in.

## 3. Mock UI Code Snippet
```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("🧬 Helix-Throttle Dashboard")
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
ingestion_metric = col1.metric("Ingestion Rate", "0 seq/s")
pressure_metric = col2.metric("Backpressure Level", "Normal")

# Placeholder for real-time data
data_placeholder = st.empty()
```
